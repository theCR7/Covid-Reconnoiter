                # About This Project
   This is basically a tool to monitor social distancing from CCTV, videos using Python, Deep learning, Computer Vision. This tool can 
   automatically estimate interpersonal distance from uncalibrated RGB cameras. Can be used at public places and workplace.

   In the fight against the COVID-19, social distancing has proven to be a very effective measure. To ensure social
   distancing protocol in public places and workplace, I have developed social distancing detection tool that can monitor
   if people are keeping a safe distance from each other by analyzing real time video streams from the camera.

   This app has following features:

   * Detect humans in the frame with yolov3.
   * Calculates the distance between every human who is detected in the frame.
   * Shows how many people are at High, Low and Not at risk.

    st.write("Compared to other region proposal classification networks (fast RCNN) which perform detection on various region proposals and thus end up performing prediction multiple times for various regions in a image, Yolo architecture is more like FCNN (fully convolutional neural network) and passes the image (nxn) once through the FCNN and output is (mxm) prediction. This the architecture is splitting the input image in mxm grid and for each grid generation 2 bounding boxes and class probabilities for those bounding boxes. Note that bounding box is more likely to be larger than the grid itself.")
